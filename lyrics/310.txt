Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
你可曾爱一个人爱到付出整只手臂【女儿的纹身占了Em整支右臂，也指Em为家庭的生活打拼】

But what happens when karma, turns right around and bites you?

What happens when you become the main source of her pain?

Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
然后转过身在歌里告诉她你有多爱她
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her

That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy
