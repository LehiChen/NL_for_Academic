You ain't got no earlobes baby
I won't hear no hating
'Cause I fear no shady in the crowd
I see so clear now baby
It's my year now baby
I can't hear when I turn this up loud
(Verse 1)
Harder than all, give me the ball, never will fall down
Ever so tall, stand from the crawl, look where we are now
I don't where to begin, it's like I'm a menace in
Just getting sicker and sicker, refuse to take my medicine
Hop on board this train leaving, ease in
Ain't nobody seeing, when I pop off gonna spark a streak inCall me heathen or demon 'cause I live free and I free 'em
Fresh in the freezer, now a heater, plus I'm well seasoned
Basses bump in a big ole truck, gonna take it up a notch or two
Been through stumps, dug up those trunks,
I threw my punch, I'm boxing through
They can huff and puff and say their stuff,
but who you talking to
All eyes on me now, just take the hint nobody watching you
A different drum everywhere that I strum
I'm like a giant on this track yelling fe fi fo fum
Yeah!
And all of you might be dumb, if you can't hear me coming
I'm stomping and shaking something

When this goes down, we pump it up loud
If they can't hear ya, pump it up louder!
From this old town, we 'bout to get down
If they can't hear ya, pump it up louder!
When this goes down, we pump it up loud
If they can't hear ya, pump it up louder!
From this old town, we 'bout to get down
If they can't hear ya, pump it up louder!
Verse 2
I make stacks 'cause a little don't last
Plus this rap got a little more class
Make this a blast, get a little more cash
Most think I'm black when I do it so fast
Check this track got me moving so fast
Mix those styles but they never do clash
Run this race got a little more dash
Don't pump those brakes, use a little more gas
Yeah, harder than steel, I kill, I will, I feel like, superman
Live by the thrill, too ill, I seal it up, and move my brand
Swoop in and fill the spot, rap and hip-hop with a little bit of pop
Ya'll like a fish out of water that's why your albums flop
It's time to shuffle, won't stop me, 'cause I've been bubbling softly
But ya'll don't come out and watch me, so I just hop in my Miati
'Cruise the blocks 'cause bro honestly, this whole rap game has haunted me
I've been broke most of my life, but you don't know what it's cost me
Somewhere deep I knew it, that new spit, refuse to be
Used by these dudes, so amused by their nuisance
Choose to be crude, just to spew out these crews
You can love it or leave it, but know I'm done being secret, now baby
