（歌名：You Don't Know）
OK let's go
Now homey I say I runnit runnit cause I'm in control
Hpnotiq, Hennessy, a couple shots of Patrón
I have ya feeling aight, I get ya high as a kite
Party-poppin shawty says she coming with me tonight
I aint shoulda' leanin',
I aint snapping and popping either
I'm bopping my head or I'm just standing there watching
I'ma hustler I hustle, you can tell that I'm paid
And I protect what I got, I'm in a house with my blade
Nigga you front you gonna get it,
OK now maybe I've said itCause I want you to triddip, yea I be on that shit hit
You should see when I'm stuntin'
I flash the stones to be wanton
Push the grip see me rollin’,
you can tell that I'm holdin’
I'm just doing my thang, you know the units the game
I got my grimey Shady with me you front
you'll have to get me
Off your ass I'll pay the lawsuit and laugh
Haha its not a big deal it's nothing but some cash
我抽着差不多的的烟 又过了差不多的一天
时间差不多的闲 我花着差不多的的钱
口味要差不多的咸 做人要差不多的贱
活在差不多的边缘 又是差不多的一年
一个差不多的台北市 有差不多的马子
差不多又干了几次 用着差不多的姿势
看着差不多的电视 吃着差不多的狗屎
写着差不多的字 又发着差不多的誓
（歌名：Still Ballin'）
Now ever since a nigga was a seed
Only thing promised to me was the penitentiary, still ballin
Ridin on these niggaz cause they lay
In a six-one Chevy, still heavy in this game, can you feel me?
Blame it on my momma I'm a thug nigga
Up befo' the sun rise, quicker than the drug dealers
Tell me if it's on, nigga then we first to bomb
Bust on these bitch-made niggaz hit 'em up, WESTSIDE
Ain't nobody love me as a broke nigga
Finger on the trigger Lord forgive me if I smoke
I love my females strapped, no fuckin from the back
I get my currency in stacks, California's where I'm at - ride
Passed by while these niggaz wonder why
I got shot but didn't die, let 'em see who's next to try
Did I cry, hell nah, nigga tear I shed
for all my homies in the pen, many peers dead
Niggaz still ballin
until the day i die
You can bring your crew but we remain true motherfucker still ballin
niggaz wonder why
You can bring your crew but we remain true motherfuckers still ballin
差不多先生他像个笑话 有闻又在叫骂
差不多要跳不起来 还是要跳要吧
差不多要像乌龟 但乌龟乌龟翘吧
这差不多的人生 他妙吗
差不多要力争上游 想游到上流
差不多在心里默念阿门和佛陀布的放流
差不多的生活很街头 再 差一点你就变成街友
?我唱了八十八个差不多 都差不多
差不多先生不会在乎这么多
日子应该怎么过 差不多的2008怎么霍
我是差不多先生 热狗
我是差不多先生
我是差不多先生
（歌名：You Don't Know）
When me and Fif’got together to do this music and movie
became enveloped
we just developed a fellowship through it
It's no pretend shit its friendship mi nemesis es su nemesis
Same for him it's just media see to them images it's just images
差不多的夜生活 又喝着差不多的酒
听着差不多的音乐 喝醉差不多的糗
有着差不多的绝望 做着差不多的梦
穿着差不多的衣服 脑袋差不多的空
差不多的挂 说着差不多抱怨的话
时间也差不多了 该我那差不多的家
差不多的瞎 指鹿为马 都差不多吧
继续吧 继续瞎子摸象吧 有差吗
我是差不多先生
