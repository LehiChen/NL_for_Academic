Aye, have you ever loved somebody so much

You can't stand it but can't do without 'em?
你受不了那爱情，没有她们却没法活
Do anything for 'em cause you truly do adore 'em
为她们能做任何事因为你真的宝贝她们
Like dedicate songs, write poems
一如献歌写诗
But they be on that bullshit and you try to ignore 'em

But you feel like they feel like you ain't right for 'em

Maybe we can leave, find someone better

Even though you will, you never known none better

My heart says nah, she can't leave, won't let her

Been head over heels since the very day I met her
和她初见之日起我就神魂颠倒，不再是我
Fell so deep in love I ain't been able to get up
爱得如此之深，我甚至走都走不出来
Sometimes I want some peace of mind and she don't shut up

We were just too dumb to notice

We wake up

On a bed of guns and roses

I buy alot of Prada, Gucci, and Balenciaga
我会买一堆普拉达，古驰和巴黎世家（均为意大利奢侈品）
To keep her content, and keep down the nonsense
让她心满意足，赶走风言风语
But every corner we turn, around the conflict

Mostly dumb shit, like who she run with?
大部分都是因为一些很蠢的事争吵，就像是她当时和谁在一起？
Where the fuck have you been? Them pants – they don't fit

Really, honestly speaking, some things I don't get

No matter how much she try she can't make it make more sense

Therefore, here we go again

Screaming, yelling at the top of our lungs, she going in
我们大声吵嚷，她钻牛角尖
Seeing the kind of shit I be like if you was a man
说着一些话，我的反应是，如果妳是个男人
I would go in your shit, real, no shit
我非揍得自己认不出妳，真的不废话
But I love her so much that I can't forget

That the feel of her kiss, it could heal when I'm sick
